One thing AI is not so good at, especially Transformers, is logic and reasoning. Sure, there are wrappers like Chain of Thought, but it is extremely time-consuming to train this into the model, and if CoT was not trained into the model, it makes the code look bulky and unclean.
If I manage to create a new and better system, and beat the other Big Tech guys to it, it would be monumental.
